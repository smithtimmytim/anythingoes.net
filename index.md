# Anythin’ Goes is the design and development company of Tim Smith in beautiful Saint Paul, Minnesota.

I design and build web applications and sites for a whole range of clients, and have been doing so for the past eight years. My career has included work for [Relay FM](https://www.relay.fm/), [Carbon Ads](https://carbonads.net/), and most notably, [The Clinton Foundation](https://ttimsmith.com/portfolio/clinton-foundation/). Please take a look at [some of my select works](https://ttimsmith.com/portfolio/).

If you’re an educator, manager, or conference organizer, let’s chat about me giving a talk or running a workshop. I can speak on a wide range of topics, like scaling CSS on large teams, growing remote teams, or how side projects can improve your design skills.
